Standing with hands raised to the sky
Slowly lowering hands to shoulder height
Extending one leg forward in a lunge
Bringing arms to cross over chest
Turning to look over shoulder
Extending one arm forward in a reach
Leaning against an imaginary wall
Placing one hand on hip
Shifting weight to one leg, other foot forward
Bending slightly at the waist
Placing hands on knees, bending forward
Sitting on one knee, other leg bent
Holding hands clasped together in front
Kneeling with arms open to the side
Gazing upward with palms raised
Stepping one foot back, leaning forward
Placing one hand on cheek thoughtfully
Bringing hands together in a prayer position
Sitting cross-legged with hands in lap
Looking down, head bowed
Lifting one arm as if to wave
Hands resting on hips, standing straight
Leaning slightly back with hands behind head
Twisting at the waist to face sideways
Crossing arms in front of chest
Looking upward, one arm reaching out
Sitting with one leg crossed, leaning back
Raising one hand to shield eyes
Placing hands behind back, standing tall
Cupping chin in one hand thoughtfully
Resting on one knee, hands on thighs
Reaching arms overhead in a stretch
Bringing hands down to shoulder height
Extending one arm sideways
Placing one hand on hip, other hand extended
Leaning back slightly with crossed arms
Turning body to side, one hand up
Gazing down, one hand at chest
Raising both hands to forehead
Sitting with one leg bent, other extended
Twisting to look behind over shoulder
Placing one hand on opposite shoulder
Raising one arm to touch face
Placing both hands on knees, leaning forward
Bringing one arm across chest, hugging self
Placing one hand on heart, other extended
Standing on one leg, other bent at knee
Leaning forward with hands clasped together
Crossing one leg over the other, arms folded
Standing with arms crossed over chest
Stretching one arm upward, other at side
Hands on back of head, leaning sideways
Sitting on knees with arms at sides
Placing hands together in a prayer gesture
Leaning forward, hands clasped at waist
Turning slightly with one arm forward
Extending one arm while other rests on hip
Bringing hands to cover face gently
Standing tall with arms at sides
Raising one leg and balancing on the other
Placing both hands on hips confidently
Sitting cross-legged with one hand up
Gazing over one shoulder, hands on hips
Holding one hand out in a beckoning motion
Raising both arms with fingers spread wide
Standing on tiptoes, reaching upward
Leaning back slightly with arms spread
Bringing hands to face in a surprised look
Crossing arms in a self-hug
Placing one foot forward, leaning on knee
Sitting with legs crossed, arms in lap
Standing with one arm on hip, other on cheek
Stretching both arms to the side
Crossing one leg in front, arms at sides
Sitting with legs stretched forward, hands behind
Hands on hips, looking off to the side
Resting on one knee with arm extended forward
Turning to side, hands resting on waist
Arms outstretched, gazing downward
Crossing arms while looking down
Standing with arms loosely at sides
Bringing one hand to chest, looking down
Resting chin on hand thoughtfully
Placing hands on knees, leaning back
Stepping forward, hand extended outward
Resting arms on knees, head slightly down
Sitting with both legs stretched, one bent
Hands pressed together, head down
One hand to forehead, other to hip
Arms spread wide, looking straight ahead
Placing one hand on heart, other to the side
Standing with arms at sides, relaxed stance
Leaning on one leg, arms crossed casually
Sitting with hands on knees, looking sideways
One arm across chest, other bent at the elbow
Gently hugging self with eyes closed
Looking up, arms extended backward
Resting hands in lap, looking downward
Leaning to one side with arms spread
Standing straight, hands interlocked behind
